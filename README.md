## Food Recipe Client ##
The recipe-client repository of this full stack web application directly to serve the users. The purpose of this application is to allow the users to create their own food recipe. The users must create the account by signup and signin then the app will allow the users to be able to create the food and view all the foods from database.

## The Main Concept ##
The main reason behide this project was from my inspiration and passion of cooking, which I have been cooking for the past 18 years as my profession. I want to keep all the recipes from my own experience and write it down where I can share with whoever has a passion in cooking. The most important thing is the users itself to be able to create their own and share with other. The extra features of this app is allows the users to update and delete their own items.

## User Stories ##
1. As a user, I want to be able to create a new food recipes.
2. As a user, I want to be able to create and update a food.
3. As a user, I want to be able to delete a food that I have created..
4. As a user, I want to be able to share my food.

## Planning and Scheduling ##
I start with these 2 links

My stategy in this project was to set up the backend first, which I have to create the Github repository API-client to support the frontend-client application and setup Rails-Heroku to support the database. Once the backend finished, I moved to the client side or the users features. I build the frontend application in the based of MVP by created the auth and the CRUD.
After that I explored and use Boostrap to import my style to customize my features in HTML file.

## List of Technology Used ##
The technology that I used to build this frontend application are Javascript, HTML5 and CSS including Boostrap. I love to play around with Boostrap because it allows me to use a lot of features such as modals section, navbar and hover effects. Handlebar is one of my fravorite tool that I love to use, which is very helpful and useful for this project.

## The most challenging in this project ##
One of the most challenging in this project was downloading the template, which I had the most difficult time to get the right version to make it work for Boostrap. The second challenging was setting up the rails-heroku for development side and link it with client production side.
   Tips: pay attention to small little symbols it can break your codes.
